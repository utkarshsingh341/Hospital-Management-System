# Hospital-Management-System
Computerizing the Front Office Management of Hospital into a software which is user friendly, simple, fast, and cost-effective

###Description
Hospitals currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of critical
information. The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread
throughout the hospital management infrastructure. Often information (on forms) is incomplete
or does not follow management standards. Forms are often lost in transit between departments
requiring a comprehensive auditing process to ensure no vital information is lost. Multiple
copies of the same information exist in the hospital and may lead to inconsistencies in data in
various data stores.
The purpose of the project entitled as “Hospital Management System” is to computerize the
Front Office Management of Hospital to develop software which is user friendly, simple, fast,
and cost – effective. The Hospital Management System will be made accessible to three types
of users – Hospital Administrator, Patients and Doctors. It deals with the collection of patient’s
data, doctor’s information, and managing of the medical inventory of the hospital, appointment
scheduling and administration as well as generation of the post-Appointment reports along with
medical prescription. The service also consists of Deep Learning based Pneumonia Predictor
tool which uses transfer learning and concludes severity of the disease based on observed
patterns in the lung X-rays.
The Hospital Management System is fast, efficient and reliable; avoids data redundancy and
inconsistency. Has a very user-friendly interface with easy accessibility of data. The number
of personnel required is considerably less and it provides more security and integrity to data.
